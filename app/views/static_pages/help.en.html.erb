  We put a lot emphasis to make the <em>Secondhand</em> application as easy to use as possible. But things that might seem obvious to us might be incomprehensible to you. Therefore we want to give you some guidance on how to use the application. If you still need help feel free to contact us by phone +49(176)98263841 or over the <%= link_to_help %>.
</p>
<p>
  Here is an outline of our explanations. This is also a typical workflow when working with <em>Secondhand</em>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#access">Get access to the application</a></li>
  <li><a href="#register">Registering lists</a></li>
  <li><a href="#collect">Collecting items</a></li>
  <li><a href="#finish">Finish your list</a></li>
  <li><a href="#print">Print your list and your labels</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
  Following are workflows you will use only occasionally
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#forward">Forward list to another seller</a></li>
  <li><a href="#sign">Sign out and sign in</a></li>
  <li><a href="#profile">Change your profile</a></li>
